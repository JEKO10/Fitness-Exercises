## Project task

The project was inspired by [JavaScript Mastery](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_fitness_app). Created in React, using 2 APIs from Rapid API, you can learn more about exercises.

## Project overview

Choose exercise categories and specific muscle groups, and search more than one thousand exercises with practical examples and related youtube videos. I also created pagination with react-paginate and a section for similar exercises for targeting muscle group or equipment.

## Built with
